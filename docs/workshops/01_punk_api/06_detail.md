# 05- Detail Route

## Goal

The main goal of this step is to start using Navigation API v1.0 to navigate between routes

You are going to:

- use `GestureDetector` to handle user gesture
- use `Function` to communicate between a child and a parent widget
- create typedef and use it
- use `Navigation` API 1.0 with anonymous and named routes

At the end of this step, you will have built this :point_down:
